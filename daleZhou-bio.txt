I'm a neuroscience PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor Danielle Bassett in the Complex Systems Group and co-advised by Professor Theodore Satterthwaite in the Psychiatric and Developmental Imaging Laboratory. My research interests include attention and learning, computational modeling, neuroimaging, psychiatry, and philosophy of mind.
